			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			PartsGenie allows for the design and optimisation of novel,
			reusable synthetic biology parts.
			<p>This user interface consists of a number of components:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Parts</b>: an interactive drag-and-drop interface for
				assembling designs from features such as promoters, ribosome
				binding sites (RBS) and coding sequences (CDS).
				<li><b>Feature</b>: a panel allowing for the specification of
				parameters relating to individual features.
				<li><b>Filters</b>: a panel for specifying filters to consider
				in optimising the parts.
				<li><b>Results</b>: a panel for displaying and querying results
				of the part optimisations.
			</ul>
			<p>In addition, there is also the functionality for saving optimised
			parts to an instance of JBEI-ICE.
			
			<h1>Parts</h1>
			The <b>Parts</b> panel offers a simple drag-and-drop interface for
			defining multiple designs from a collection of features represented
			as buttons.
			<p><img src="static/help/parts.png" alt="Parts" class="help"/>
			<p>The user can build up a design by dragging-and-dropping features
			from the palette of grey buttons. Tablet and smartphone users can
			add features to the design by double-clicking on the feature button
			in the palette.
			<p>The features available are described below in the feature section.
			<p>Individual designs may be named.
			<p>Upon selecting a given feature, the <b>Feature</b> panel becomes
			visible, allowing the specification of parameters specific to that
			feature. Examples of this include an amino acid sequence for a CDS,
			or a translation initiation rate (TIR) for an RBS. The feature will
			be bordered by a red warning box until these necessary features are
			specified.
			<p>Note that a restriction exists such that a RBS <b>must</b> be
			immediately followed by a CDS. Again, the RBS will be bordered by
			a red warning box if this restriction is not adhered to.
			<p>In the case of optimising RBS or CDS, an <b>Organism</b> must be
			specified from the autofill field.
			<p>Multiple designs may be specified, by either clicking the '+' icon,
			or by duplicating a specified design through the Copy icon. Individual
			designs can be viewed and edited by clicking the numbered pagination
			panel. Designs may be deleted, as can individual features within designs.
