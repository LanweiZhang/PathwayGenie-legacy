			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			PartsGenie allows for the design and optimisation of novel,
			reusable synthetic biology parts.
			<p>This user interface consists of a number of components:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Parts</b>: an interactive drag-and-drop interface for
				assembling designs from features such as promoters, ribosome
				binding sites (RBS) and coding sequences (CDS).
				<li><b>Feature</b>: a panel allowing for the specification of
				parameters relating to individual features.
				<li><b>Filters</b>: a panel for specifying filters to consider
				in optimising the parts.
				<li><b>Results</b>: a panel for displaying and querying results
				of the part optimisations.
			</ul>
			<p>In addition, there is also the functionality for saving optimised
			parts to an instance of JBEI-ICE.
			
			<h1>Parts</h1>
			The <b>Parts</b> panel offers a simple drag-and-drop interface for
			defining multiple designs from a collection of features represented
			as buttons.
			<p><img src="static/help/parts.png" alt="Parts" class="help"/>
			<p>The user can build up a design by dragging-and-dropping features
			from the palette of grey buttons. Tablet and smartphone users can
			add features to the design by double-clicking on the feature button
			in the palette.
			<p>The features available are described below in the feature section.
			<p>Individual designs may be named.
			<p>Upon selecting a given feature, the <b>Feature</b> panel becomes
			visible, allowing the specification of parameters specific to that
			feature. Examples of this include an amino acid sequence for a CDS,
			or a translation initiation rate (TIR) for an RBS. The feature will
			be bordered by a red warning box until these necessary features are
			specified.
			<p>Note that a restriction exists such that a RBS <b>must</b> be
			immediately followed by a CDS. Again, the RBS will be bordered by
			a red warning box if this restriction is not adhered to.
			<p>In the case of optimising RBS or CDS, an <b>Organism</b> must be
			specified from the autofill field.
			<p>Multiple designs may be specified, by either clicking the '+' icon,
			or by duplicating a specified design through the Copy icon. Individual
			designs can be viewed and edited by clicking the numbered pagination
			panel. Designs may be deleted, as can individual features within designs.
			
			<h1>Feature</h1>
			The <b>Feature</b> panel is viewed on selecting a given feature in
			the <b>Design</b> panel.
			<p>The <b>Feature</b> panel is specific to the
			selected feature, which can be one of the following types:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Defined sequence</b>.
				<li><b>Randomised sequence</b>.
				<li><b>Sequence of defined melting temperature</b>.
				<li><b>Origin of replication</b>.
				<li><b>Promoter</b>.
				<li><b>Ribosome binding site</b>.
				<li><b>Coding sequence</b>.
				<li><b>Terminator</b>.
			</ul>
			<p>In ease case, an individual <b>Feature</b> can be named.
			<p>In the cases of <b>Defined sequence</b>, <b>Origin of replication</b>,
			<b>Promoter</b> and <b>Terminator</b>, the only required parameter
			is the nucleotide <b>Sequence</b> itself. This sequence is fixed and
			not optimised by the PartsGenie algorithm.
			<p><b>Randomised sequence</b> requires a <b>Length</b> of the sequence,
			which is periodically mutated through the optimisation sequence to
			optimise the design as a whole.
			<p>A <b>Sequence of defined melting temperature</b> requires a defined
			melting temperature (<b>Tm</b>).
			<p><b>Ribosome binding site</b>s require a desired translation initiation
			rate <b>TIR</b>.
			<p><b>Coding sequence</b>s require an <b>Amino acid sequence</b> to
			be specified, which may be extracted automatically through the
			<b>Search Uniprot</b> facility:
