			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			PartsGenie allows for the design and optimisation of novel,
			reusable synthetic biology parts.
			<p>This user interface consists of a number of components:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Parts</b>: an interactive drag-and-drop interface for
				assembling designs from features such as promoters, ribosome
				binding sites and coding sequences.
				<li><b>Feature</b>: a panel allowing for the specification of
				parameters relating to individual features.
				<li><b>Filters</b>: a panel for specifying filters to consider
				in optimising the parts.
				<li><b>Results</b>: a panel for displaying and querying results
				of the part optimisations.
			</ul>
			<p>In addition, there is also the functionality for saving optimised
			parts to an instance of JBEI-ICE.
